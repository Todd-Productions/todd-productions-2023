 # SEO
 - [ ] Nav burger button - Buttons do not have an accessible name
 - [ ] Contact page form - The value of an ARIA ID must be unique & Form fields with multiple labels
 - [ ] Possibly adjust text grey color (Crumbs, Content) - Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio
 - [ ] Nav links - Interactive elements like buttons and links should be large enough (48x48px), and have enough space around them, to be easy enough to tap without overlapping onto other elements

# Backlog
- [ ] update netlify from sb to prod
- [ ] Add some type of loading placeholder while fetching specific site/sample data, use boolean for template
