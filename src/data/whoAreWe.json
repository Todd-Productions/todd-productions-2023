      "bio": "<p>Todd Stanton conceived, produced, and edited his first film in the Spring of 1978 using his family’s Super 8mm camera. “Journey to the Sand Planet” was inspired by, among other things, Saturday mornings spent with his brother watching “creature features” and Todd’s first encounters with the outer space drama, Star Wars. Ever since that time, he has pursued storytelling through film production.</p><p>“With film, you can convey and share with someone so much more than with words alone,” says Todd. “Film expresses a point in time, specific experiences, progress, even the evolution of technology ...”</p><p>In the late 1980s, Todd’s creative outlet through filmmaking turned into his first paying gigs shooting and editing videos for weddings. This first evolution of Todd Productions grew quietly for 15 years while Todd worked in machine design and project management for Toledo area engineering firms. He became part owner in one of the companies.</p><p>“Those jobs paid the bills,” says Todd. “What got me excited were opportunities to introduce video into our machine design projects so that we could demonstrate proper maintenance of the proprietary equipment we built. That’s where we added value where other firms could not.”</p><p>As time went on, Todd could not ignore his desire to focus on media services exclusively. In 1999, Todd Productions evolved again and became a full-time video production firm, working with local, regional, and global companies. Within a few years, Todd added website design, programming, and hosting to his menu of services with the addition of Dan Korzeniewski and later, his son, Andrew Stanton to the team.</p><p>Twenty-five years later, creating compelling brand stories across multimedia remains the focus of the company Todd first envisioned. Personally, he continues to produce story-based films for his friends and family, under the name Three Quarters Entertainment. He also spends his free time writing, producing, and performing original music and creating novelty items and commercial products with 3D printing.</p><p>In 2024, Todd Productions, Inc. will become the parent company to Stanton Media Group, the new brand that encompasses video production, website development, hosting, Search Engine Optimization services, as well as 3D printing.</p>"

      "bio": "<p>Andrew Stanton is Senior Web Developer for Todd Productions. He has 14 years of experience managing and consulting for website development and maintenance, including UI design, application development, and search engine optimization.</p><p>Andrew believes that “good code happens before a single line is written.” For him, that talent began to emerge in his teens, where he placed in the top three in the Business Professionals of America’s State of Ohio competition for Web Application Development. This achievement later provided him the opportunity to develop Software as a Service (SaaS) for University of Toledo Pharmacology students. Today, he is most proud of the projects he has been leading for the U.S. Coast Guard approved Sea School, based in Jacksonville, Florida.</p><p>“Building a web application in an efficient manner and delivering high-quality code in a way that will improve productivity has been gratifying,” says Andrew. “Over the last five years, our development work continuously improves and evolves with the ever-changing needs of users within a very specialized, maritime training system.”</p><p>Andrew is newly married to Jennifer. He enjoys playing and writing music, watching movies, and traveling to new places domestically and abroad.</p>"
