    "description": "<p>Do you want to create a music video of your solo or band&apos;s performance at a local event? Maybe it&apos;s a video to post on social media or your website to bring in new fans, a short documentary about your musical process or song creation, or a promotional video to boost hype for an upcoming album.</p><p>You may be an aspiring musician who wants to create a video with lyrics. Perhaps you want intimate footage of your performance. Todd Productions&apos; has the capability of providing simple single-camera shoots up to multi-camera shoots at live performances or recording sessions. As experienced musicians ourselves, we understand what you are trying to achieve … because we&apos;ve done the same with our own band. So you won&apos;t have to explain to us the details of music recordings. And that will free you up to focus on your music.</p>",
