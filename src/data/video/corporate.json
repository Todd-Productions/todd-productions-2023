    "description": "<p>Did you start your business in a single-car garage? Are you a fourth generation member of the family who owns and operates the business? Has your company grown quickly? All of these stories provide clients with a historical perspective of your company&apos;s rich history. And what better way to capture that history than with a corporate video.</p><p>Has there been an important management change in your company? Are you instituting a new corporate philosophy that needs to be communicated to employees worldwide? Corporate videos can connect you with employees, clients and stakeholders on important issues. They are also great for recruiting to show potential employees what your work environment is really like.</p><p>Todd Productions&apos; video work includes in-town businesses, medium-sized regional companies, and large multi-national corporations. Our team will work closely with your staff to develop a script, brainstorm ideas for video scenarios, film, record, and provide post-production editing with narration and music as needed.</p>",
