      "bio": "<p>Andrew Stanton is Senior Web Developer for Todd Productions. He has 14 years of experience managing and consulting for website development and maintenance, including UI design, application development, and search engine optimization.</p><p>Andrew believes that “good code happens before a single line is written.” For him, that talent began to emerge in his teens, where he placed in the top three in the Business Professionals of America’s State of Ohio competition for Web Application Development. This achievement later provided him the opportunity to develop Software as a Service (SaaS) for University of Toledo Pharmacology students. Today, he is most proud of the projects he has been leading for the U.S. Coast Guard approved Sea School, based in Jacksonville, Florida.</p><p>“Building a web application in an efficient manner and delivering high-quality code in a way that will improve productivity has been gratifying,” says Andrew. “Over the last five years, our development work continuously improves and evolves with the ever-changing needs of users within a very specialized, maritime training system.”</p><p>Andrew is newly married to Jennifer. He enjoys playing and writing music, watching movies, and traveling to new places domestically and abroad.</p>"
